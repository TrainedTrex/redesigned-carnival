[Main Readme](README.md)

## Description

You will need to add assets to your account's asset list to be able to access them from CesiumJS. This is a walkthrough of how to do that.

The supplied code already has some assets listed, default Cesium assets from the Asset depo will have a constant asset ID# so there is no need to change the code for them. Any custom 3D tiles or image layers that are uploaded by the user WILL have a unique asset ID# so they might need to be changed in the code.

- Log into [Cesium Ion](https://ion.cesium.com/)
- Navigate to Asset Depo
- Click the "+" icon next to the assets you want to add

- Navigate to My Assets
- Take note of the Asset ID#, you will need this in order to reference it in the code.
- Alternatively, you can copy the code in the lower right and use as you see fit in your CesiumJS App
